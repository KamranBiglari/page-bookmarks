## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

The package configuration file is located at `config/page-bookmarks.php`. Here are the main configuration options:

```php
return [
    // Table names (customizable to avoid conflicts)
    'tables' => [
        'bookmarks' => 'bookmarks',
        'bookmark_folders' => 'bookmark_folders',
    ],

    // User model for bookmark associations
    'models' => [
        'user' => \App\Models\User::class,
    ],

    // Icons used throughout the interface
    'icons' => [
        'add_bookmark' => 'heroicon-o-folder-plus',
        'view_bookmarks' => 'heroicon-o-bookmark',
        'bookmark_item' => 'heroicon-o-bookmark',
        'folder' => 'heroicon-o-folder',
        'search' => 'heroicon-o-magnifying-glass',
        'delete' => 'heroicon-o-trash',
        'chevron_down' => 'heroicon-o-chevron-down',
        'empty_state' => 'heroicon-o-bookmark',
    ],

    // Render hook positions in Filament
    'render_hooks' => [
        'add_bookmark' => \Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook::GLOBAL_SEARCH_AFTER,
        'view_bookmarks' => \Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook::GLOBAL_SEARCH_AFTER,
    ],
];
```

This package utilizes Filament's theming system, so you'll need to set up a custom theme to properly style all components.

> [!NOTE] Before proceeding, ensure you have configured a custom theme if you're using Filament Panels. Check the [Filament documentation on themes](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/panels/themes) for detailed instructions. This step is required for both the Panels Package and standalone Forms package.

To properly compile all the package styles, update your Tailwind configuration by adding the package's view paths

### Customizing Render Hooks

You can customize where the bookmark components appear in your Filament panel by modifying the `render_hooks` configuration:

```php
'render_hooks' => [
    'add_bookmark' => \Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook::GLOBAL_SEARCH_AFTER,
    'view_bookmarks' => \Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook::GLOBAL_SEARCH_AFTER,
],
```

For a complete list of available render hook options, please refer to the [official Filament documentation](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/support/render-hooks). The documentation includes all available `PanelsRenderHook` constants and their specific use cases.

## Usage

### Adding the HasBookmarks Trait

To enable bookmark functionality for your User model, add the `HasBookmarks` trait:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use JaysonTemporas\PageBookmarks\Traits\HasBookmarks;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasBookmarks;

    // ... rest of your User model
}
```

## Customization

### Custom Icons

You can customize the icons used throughout the interface by modifying the `icons` configuration:

```php
'icons' => [
    'add_bookmark' => 'heroicon-o-bookmark-square',
    'view_bookmarks' => 'heroicon-o-bookmark',
    // ... other icons
],
```

### Custom Table Names

If you need to avoid table name conflicts, you can customize the table names:

```php
'tables' => [
    'bookmarks' => 'my_custom_bookmarks',
    'bookmark_folders' => 'my_custom_bookmark_folders',
],
```

### Custom User Model

If you have a custom User model, update the configuration:

```php
'models' => [
    'user' => \App\Models\CustomUser::class,
],
```
